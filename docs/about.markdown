[Fantastic](https://github.com/InfoSecInnovations/project-fantastic) is a visual tool being developed by [InfoSec Innovations](https://www.infosecinnovations.com/)

It aims to facilitate analyzing and fixing security issues on a computer network using the following features:
- Graph showing all the hosts on the network
- Actions you can perform on individual hosts or a selection
- A quest system featuring story quests to guide you through increasing your security in a logical order and daily quests to remind you to run some routine operations
- Easily extendable to write your own modules
- Open source so you can check what it's doing behind the scenes

It is still in active development, so expect some bugs and some missing features. We would love to hear what you think so far, and what you would like to see from this kind of software.
