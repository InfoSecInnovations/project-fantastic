# Fantastic CLI Tool

Fantastic is a visualizing tool made by [InfoSec Innovations](https://www.infosecinnovations.com/) for exploring computer networks. It aims to provide a way for network security novices and professionals alike to find and fix security issues. If you don't know where to start, the quest system (work in progress!) will guide you, or you can ignore it and try out the various options by yourself.

This tool allows you to create an installation by simply running `npx fantastic-cli init` in the directory where you wish to install Fantastic.

[See the GitHub repository](https://github.com/besimorhino/project-fantastic) for more information on how to install and use Fantastic.
